# SimScore API Specifications

To keep the core API sleek while providing advanced features like the relationship graph and pairwise similarity matrix, we can add an optional **query parameter** to enable these advanced features. This way, users can request these extra outputs without cluttering the basic functionality.

Hereâ€™s an updated version of the API specification with advanced options:

---

### **SimScore API Specification (with Advanced Features)**

### **Base URL**

`https://api.simscore.com`

### **Endpoints**

1. **POST /rank-ideas**
    
    This endpoint will accept a list of subjective opinions (ideas), calculate similarity scores, assign clusters, and optionally include advanced outputs such as the relationship graph and pairwise similarity matrix.

### **Advanced Features Overview**

- **Relationship Graph**: Provides a visual structure of how ideas relate to one another based on similarity scores. Useful for understanding the interconnections between different ideas.
- **Pairwise Similarity Matrix**: A matrix that shows the similarity between each pair of ideas. This is particularly useful for further analysis of idea clusters and relationships.
- **Cluster Names:**  Provides cluster names for each cluster determined in the SimScore Analysis.

This specification keeps the core functionality simple, while offering the relationship graph and pairwise similarity matrix as optional advanced features when required. The user can toggle them via the `advanced_features` parameter.

## Implementation Plan

- Create test suite and follow TDD for accurate and reliable results
- Create documentation for all API endpoints (tests will help with that)
- Improve endpoints & return values for easier public consumption
- Create postman collection for API (investigate); possibly use that for tests & documentation
- Investigate auto-documentation features
- Create `dev` and `prod` environments ~~(possibly also `staging` and/or `testing`, but likely not necessary)~~
- See https://community.fly.io/t/managing-multiple-environments/107/31 how to do that with fly.io
- ~~Create `dev` and `prod` databases (if required)~~
- CI/CD integration
    - Run tests on every push
    - Run tests on timed intervals (daily)
- User limitations
    - ~~Authentication?~~
    - Rate limiting (max 1000 reqs/minute; max 10 req/min/user)
- ~~Setup Auto-scaling?~~
    - ~~Make sure that more servers spin up when request is high~~
- Set up Error messaging & fault limits
    - Automatically message a sysadmin when there are errors
    - ~~Message when requests go above a specified limit, i.e. costs would go very high or similar~~
- Make sure others can be onboarded easily:
    - Good code documentation
    - Easy pipelines / good pipeline documentation (i.e. how to run tests, how to update code, how to maintain databases, etc)
